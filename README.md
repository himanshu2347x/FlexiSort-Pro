## FlexiSort Pro: Advanced Dynamic Sorting Library with Parallel Processing

# Overview

FlexiSort Pro is a highly customizable and efficient C++ sorting library designed for advanced sorting needs.
It allows users to plug in custom comparator functions, dynamically select between various sorting algorithms, and handle special cases such as nearly sorted data or large datasets.
The library also features parallel processing capabilities to enhance performance.

# Concept

The library provides:

Custom Comparator Functions: Users can define their own comparison logic to sort different data types.

Dynamic Algorithm Selection: Automatically chooses the most suitable sorting algorithm based on data characteristics and algorithm efficiency.

Special Case Handling: Optimized solutions for nearly sorted data and large datasets.

# Why It Stands Out

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. FlexiSort Pro stands out by offering a highly customizable, efficient sorting solution that demonstrates a deep understanding of algorithm optimization and practical application in real-world scenarios. The addition of parallel processing capabilities further enhances its performance for large datasets.

# Features

Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Includes QuickSort, MergeSort, HeapSort, BubbleSort, SelectionSort, InsertionSort, and TimSort.

Dynamic Algorithm Selection: Automatically selects the best sorting algorithm based on data inversion count, data size and nature of the dataset to ensure efficient performance.

Custom Comparator Functions: Allows sorting of various data types with user-defined comparison logic.

Support for Custom Data Types: Enhance compatibility with user-defined data types and structures.

Parallel Sorting: Utilizes multi-threading to efficiently handle large datasets.
